# Hayrunnisa-Iyikosker
Software Engineering Student | Computer Vision & 3D Measurement

## About Me
I'm a software engineering student interested in **computer vision** and **industrial measurement systems**.  
I build engineering-oriented projects that combine computer vision with real-world industrial problems.

**Current Focus**: 3D vision-based measurement, object detection, and optimization

## Projects

### Industrial Stone Measurement
[Repository](https://github.com/hayrunnisaiyikosker/industrial-stone-measurement)

A 3D vision-based measurement prototype for analyzing natural stone dimensions as a foundation for cutting optimization.
- ZED stereo camera integration for real-time measurement
- Point cloud processing and 3D analysis
- Oriented bounding box–based dimension estimation
- Industrial-oriented reporting  
- **Tech**: Python, Open3D, OpenCV, ZED SDK

### Learning Object Detection
[Repository](https://github.com/hayrunnisaiyikosker/learning-object-detection)

Hands-on object detection experiments while learning computer vision fundamentals.
- Object detection with YOLO (v5 / v8)
- Real-time camera inference
- Model experimentation and performance analysis

## Skills
**Languages**: Python, C  
**Computer Vision**: OpenCV, Open3D, YOLO  
**Frameworks & Tools**: PyQt5, Git, Linux  
**Other**: NumPy, image processing, 3D visualization
